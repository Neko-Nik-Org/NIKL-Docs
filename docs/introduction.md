## 🔤 What's in a Name?

The name **NIKL** is a blend of personal and symbolic meaning:

- **Nik** comes from **Neko Nik**, derived from **Nikhil** — the creator's name  
- **Neko** (猫) means *cat* in Japanese 🐱 — light, agile, and independent  
- **L** stands for **Language**, but also completes the phonetic sound of **Nikhil**  
- **Nickel**, a lightweight and resilient metal, reflects the language’s design goals: **lightweight**, **robust**, and **efficient**
